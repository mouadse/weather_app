# Weather App in Python

The Python program you are looking at uses three different Python libraries: **requests**, **beautifulsoup**, and **asyncio**. These libraries are used to fetch and parse weather data from the Yandex Weather site **meteum.ai**.

> **Note:** We parsed the data from the website instead of using the API because it's way faster.(V2 will be using an API and the JSON library).
